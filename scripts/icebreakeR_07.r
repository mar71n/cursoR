# Simple Descriptions

# Ya tenemos visto un numero de diferentes                                      pero es util considerarlos 
# de un modo mas holistico y coordinado. Vamos a empezar por procesar los datos de acuerdo a nuestra primer estrategia
# We have already seen a number of different data summary and analysis tools, but it is useful to consider
# them in a more coordinated and holistic fashion. We start by reading and processing the data according
# to our earlier strategy.
ufc <- read.csv("../data/ufc.csv")
ufc$height.m <- ufc$height/10
ufc$dbh.cm <- ufc$dbh/10
table(ufc$height.m) # hay un 0.0
ufc$height.m[ufc$height.m < 0.1] <- NA
ufc$species[ufc$species %in% c("F","FG")] <- "GF"
ufc$species <- factor(ufc$species)
ufc.baf <- 7
cm.to.inches <- 1/2.54
m.to.feet <- 3.281
bd.ft.to.m3 <- 0.002359737
ufc$g.ma2 <- ufc$dbh.cm^2*pi/40000
ufc$tree.factor <- ufc.baf / ufc$g.ma2
ufc$tree.factor[is.na(ufc$dbh.cm)] <- 0
# Here, we will drop the plots that have no trees, although we will keep track of them in the plot count.
# Aca esta, queremos dar de baja las parcelas que no tienen harboles, aunque queremos conservarlas para la cuenta de parcelas 
number.of.plots <- length(unique(ufc$plot)) # primero cuento las parcelas
ufc <- ufc[!is.na(ufc$dbh.cm), ]            # despues de contarlas, quito los registros sin harboles
ufc$species <- factor(ufc$species)

# 7.1 Univariate
# In what follows we distinguish between summaries of continuous data, also called numerical, and cate-
#   gorical data. Ordinal data can be considered a special case of the latter for our purposes. I don't see any
# particular reason to further subdivide continuous data into interval and ratio data.

# 7.1.1 Numerical
# Getting standard estimates of the location and spread of variables is very easy; these are obtained by
# the following commands. Note the use of the argument na.rm=TRUE, which tells R to ignore the missing
# values.
# Measures of location
mean(ufc$dbh.cm, na.rm = TRUE)
# [1] 35.65662
# ?mean # media aritmetica, promedio


median(ufc$dbh.cm, na.rm = TRUE)
# [1] 32.9

mode(ufc$dbh.cm)
summary(ufc$dbh.cm)


hist(ufc$dbh.cm)





# Measures of spread
sd(ufc$dbh.cm, na.rm = TRUE)
# [1] 17.68945
# ?sd # desviacion standar
range(ufc$dbh.cm, na.rm = TRUE)
# [1] 10 112
IQR(ufc$dbh.cm, na.rm = TRUE)
# [1] 23.45
?IQR # rango intercuantil
summary(ufc$dbh.cm)[[5]]-summary(ufc$dbh.cm)[[2]]

# Measures of skew
# A skewness() function can be found in the moments package. Alternatively we can compare the data with
# a known non-skewed dataset; the normal distribution (see Figure 7.1). These data are, not surprisingly,
# positively skewed (i.e. they have a long right tail).
qqnorm(ufc$dbh.cm, xlab = "Diameter (cm)")  
qqline(ufc$dbh.cm, col = "darkgrey")

?qqnorm

# Figure 7.1: Demonstration of normal quantile plot to assess skew. These data are, not surprisingly,
# positively skewed (i.e. they have a long right tail).
# El diametro no tiene asimetrias, es ecir tiene un tallo largo y derecho.

# 7.1.2 Categorical

# The most common data summary for categorical variables is tabulation. There are several ways that
# data can be tabulated in R. Their dierence is in how 
# exible the commands are and the kind of output
# generated.
table(ufc$species)
# DF ES GF HW LP PP SF WC WL WP
# 77 3 188 5 7 4 14 251 34 44
tapply(ufc$species, ufc$species, length)

# 77 3 188 5 7 4 14 251 34 44

# 4 HW 5
# 5 LP 7
# 6 PP 4
# 7 SF 14
# 8 WC 251
# 9 WL 34
# 10 WP 44
# These tables can be easily converted to gures (see Figure 7.2).
plot(table(ufc$species), ylab = "Raw Stem Count")
plot(as.table(tapply(ufc$tree.factor/number.of.plots, ufc$species,
                        sum)), ylab = "Stems per Hectare")

# Figure 7.2: Raw count of trees by species (left panel) and weighted by tree factor (right panel).
# Continuous variates can also be converted into ordinal variates for further analysis using the cut()
# unction. For example, here we cut the tree diameters into 20 cm classes, making a new factor that has
# ordered levels.
ufc$dbh.20 <- cut(ufc$dbh.cm, breaks = (0:6) * 20)
table(ufc$dbh.20)
# (0,20] (20,40] (40,60] (60,80] (80,100] (100,120]

# 7.2 Multivariate

# We will consider three cases that oer bivariate information; when there is conditioning on a categorical
# variable (e.g. species), and also when there is more than one variable of interest, be they numerical or
# categorical.

# 7.2.1 Numerical/Numerical

# We have already seen a scatterplot of two continuous variates, and we are not interested in formally
# tting models at this point. So, the correlation is a quick and useful summary of the level of agreement
# between two continuous variates. Note that the na.rm argument that we have become accustomed to is
# not used in this function, instead we use the use argument. See ?cor for more details.
cor(ufc$dbh.cm, ufc$height.m, use = "complete.obs")
# [1] 0.7794116 
?cor # Correlation, Variance and Covariance (Matrices)
cor.test(ufc$dbh.cm, ufc$height.m, use = "complete.obs")
?cor.test

# 7.2.2 Numerical/Categorical
# We will most commonly be interested in obtaining summaries of the numerical variable conditioned upon
# the categorical variable. We have seen how to do this in several ways. The main dierence between
# the tapply() and aggregate() functions is in the structure of the output. tapply() creates a named
# list, and aggregate() creates a dataframe with the labels as a separate column. Also, aggregate() will
# compute the nominated function for more than one variable of interest.

# one categorical variable.
